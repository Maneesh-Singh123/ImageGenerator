# **Image Generation Frontend Project**

This project is a web-based front-end that interacts with a backend API for image generation. The backend uses **StackGAN** for generating images from text descriptions, powered by **TensorFlow** for model implementation, and **Word2Vec** for text embedding. The API is built using **FastAPI** and deployed on **Heroku**. We also integrate **NVIDIA Triton** for efficient model inference and deployment.

## **Introduction**

This project allows users to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. By leveraging **StackGAN** (Generative Adversarial Networks), we convert text-based inputs into realistic images. The frontend is built to send requests to a backend API powered by **FastAPI**, which handles the text embedding, model inference, and image generation processes. The system is designed for seamless deployment on **Heroku** with inference optimization through **NVIDIA Triton**.

## **Technologies**

### **Frontend**
- HTML5 / CSS3 /Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript / React 
- Responsive Design

### **Backend**
- **FastAPI** - API framework for building high-performance backend.
- **StackGAN** - Image generation model used for generating images from text descriptions.
- **TensorFlow** - Used to implement the StackGAN model.
- **Word2Vec** - Text embedding model that converts words to vector representations.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow 2.0+**
- **FastAPI**
- **NVIDIA Triton**
- **Heroku CLI**

### **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maneesh-singh123/ImageGeneration.git
cd yourprojectname
```

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv        # For Linux/MacOS
   python -m venv venv        # For Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up TensorFlow and StackGAN**:
   Follow the instructions to install TensorFlow and StackGAN models from their official repositories. Download the pre-trained models if available, or train the models based on your dataset.
   - **Download and Install Tensorflow at one step:** pip install tensorflow
   - Download pre-tarained StackGAN from official site

3. **Start FastAPI backend**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   Navigate to the frontend directory (if using React, for example):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

## **Usage**

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port) to access the application.

### **Image Generation Process**

1. Enter a textual description of the image you want to generate.
2. The frontend sends the input to the backend API.
3. The backend processes the input using Word2Vec to convert the text into embeddings.
4. StackGAN generates the corresponding image using the TensorFlow model.
5. The generated image is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.

---

## **API Reference**

The API exposes an endpoint for image generation.

### **POST** `/generate-image`
Generates an image from a given text input.

#### Request:
```json
{
  "text": "a description of the image to be generated"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "image_url": "url_to_generated_image"
}
```

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description**            |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------|
| `text`        | String   | Text description of the image |

### **Error Handling**
- 400: Invalid input text
- 500: Internal server error (e.g., model inference failure)

---

## **Deployment**

### **Deploying on Heroku**
1. **Create a Heroku app**:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

2. **Push the code to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

3. **Set environment variables** for the StackGAN model, TensorFlow, and Triton on Heroku by using:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set VAR_NAME=value
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   The app will be deployed to `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.

### **NVIDIA Triton Deployment**
To leverage NVIDIA Triton for model inference:
- Package your trained StackGAN model as a Triton Model Repository.
- Configure Triton for scalable inference on your backend server.
- Triton will optimize and manage the inference requests received by the FastAPI server.
